  abstract = {Many genetic diseases and undesirable traits are due to base-pair alterations in genomic DNA. Base-editing, the newest evolution of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas-based technologies, can directly install point-mutations in cellular DNA without inducing a double-strand DNA break (DSB). Two classes of DNA base-editors have been described thus far, cytosine base-editors (CBEs) and adenine base-editors (ABEs). Recently, prime-editing (PE) has further expanded the CRISPR-base-edit toolkit to all twelve possible transition and transversion mutations, as well as small insertion or deletion mutations. Safe and efficient delivery of editing systems to target cells is one of the most paramount and challenging components for the therapeutic success of BEs. Due to its broad tropism, well-studied serotypes, and reduced immunogenicity, adeno-associated vector (AAV) has emerged as the leading platform for viral delivery of genome editing agents, including DNA-base-editors. In this review, we describe the development of various base-editors, assess their technical advantages and limitations, and discuss their therapeutic potential to treat debilitating human diseases.},

  abstract = {Prime editing enables the introduction of virtually any small-sized genetic change without requiring donor DNA or double-strand breaks. However, evaluation of prime editing efficiency requires time-consuming experiments, and the factors that affect efficiency have not been extensively investigated. In this study, we performed high-throughput evaluation of prime editor 2 (PE2) activities in human cells using 54,836 pairs of prime editing guide RNAs (pegRNAs) and their target sequences. The resulting data sets allowed us to identify factors affecting PE2 efficiency and to develop three computational models to predict pegRNA efficiency. For a given target sequence, the computational models predict efficiencies of pegRNAs with different lengths of primer binding sites and reverse transcriptase templates for edits of various types and positions. Testing the accuracy of the predictions using test data sets that were not used for training, we found Spearman’s correlations between 0.47 and 0.81. Our computational models and information about factors affecting PE2 efficiency will facilitate practical application of prime editing.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Most short sequences can be precisely written into a selected genomic target using prime editing; however, it remains unclear what factors govern insertion. We design a library of 3,604 sequences of various lengths and measure the frequency of their insertion into four genomic sites in three human cell lines, using different prime editor systems in varying DNA repair contexts. We find that length, nucleotide composition and secondary structure of the insertion sequence all affect insertion rates. We also discover that the 3′ flap nucleases TREX1 and TREX2 suppress the insertion of longer sequences. Combining the sequence and repair features into a machine learning model, we can predict relative frequency of insertions into a site with               R               \,=\,0.70. Finally, we demonstrate how our accurate prediction and user-friendly software help choose codon variants of common fusion tags that insert at high efficiency, and provide a catalog of empirically determined insertion rates for over a hundred useful sequences.},

Over the years biological therapy evolved from using stem cells and viral vectors to RNA therapy and testing different genome editing tools as promising gene therapy agents. These genome editing technologies (Zinc finger nucleases, TAL effector nucleases), specifically CRISPR-Cas system, revolutionized the field of genetic engineering and is widely applied to create cell and animal models for various hereditary, infectious human diseases and cancer, to analyze and understand the molecular and cellular base of pathogenesis, to find potential drug/treatment targets, to eliminate pathogenic DNA changes in various medical conditions and to create future “precise medication”. Although different concerning factors, such as precise system delivery to the target cells, efficacy and accuracy of editing process, different approaches of making the DNA changes as well as worrying bioethical issues remain, the importance of genome editing technologies in medicine is undeniable. The future of innovative genome editing approach and strategies to treat diseases is complicated but interesting and exciting at once for all related parties – researchers, clinicians, and patients.},

These datasets enabled a systematic determination of factors affecting prime editing efficiencies. Then, we developed computational models, named DeepPrime and DeepPrime-FT, that can predict prime editing efficiencies for eight prime editing systems in seven cell types for all possible types of editing of up to 3 base pairs. We also extensively profiled the prime editing efficiencies at mismatched targets and developed a computational model predicting editing efficiencies at such targets. These computational models, together with our improved knowledge about prime editing efficiency determinants, will greatly facilitate prime editing applications.},
