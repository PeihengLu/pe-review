PRIDICT 2 makes a further step towards improving the prediction accuracy by updating the data preprocessing and model training step. By implementing multitask learning sharing the embedding and bidirectional RNN layers, PRIDICT 2 is able to predict the editing efficiency of prime editing guides with higher accuracy than its predecessor\cite{mathisMachineLearningPrediction2024}.
