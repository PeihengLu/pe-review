We present PE Ensemble, a web-based application that integrates multiple in-silico prime editing guide design tools. PE Ensemble provides a user-friendly interface for users to design prime editing guides and evaluate their on-target efficiencies. The application also allows users to aggregate the results from multiple tools using weighted mean ensemble learning to improve the overall guide design quality.
